# TalentPlan_kvs    
I will structure my projects by the origin way from the course    
âœ”project1    
Tips: The beginning of the project1 requires pass the cli_* tests, so the KvsStore's methods must use    
eprint!("unimplemented")    
unimplemented!()    
after that if you want to pass the other tests you must finish the methods body. So the at the last there are three cli_* tests won't pass
